    <h2>Introducing: The Minitest Cookbook</h2>

    <p>
      If you want to use even the most simple tool effectively, you
      need to know how to hold it.  That's why I'm writing <b>The
      Minitest Cookbook</b> - to help Ruby and Rails developers at all
      skill levels master the techniques they need to write clear,
      maintainable tests and help others to do the same.  That process
      begins with a set of fundamentals where you'll learn how to:

      <ul>
	<li>Write tests using both assertions and specs</li>
	<li>Structure your tests for clarity and confidence</li>
	<li>Validate your code with assertions and expectations</li>
	<li>Use mocks, stubs, and other kinds of test doubles</li>
	<li>Effectively manage test data</li>
	<li>Share common code between tests</li>
	<li>Run one test case or your whole suite</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you've covered the basics and your feel you're ready to
      move to the next level, we've got you covered, and so does
      Minitest. Because even though it's compact, Minitest is also
      super flexible and ready to test whatever sort of Ruby code you
      want to throw at it.  It's based around a simple architecture
      and supports customizations via plugins, so you'll be able to
      trick out your testing stack with third-party gems from a large
      and growing ecosystem of plugins.  Later sections of the book
      will deal with advanced topics on a deeper level including how to:
      <ul>
	<li>Test your Rails 5 applications from top to bottom</li>
	<li>Customize your test reports with better, more actionable information</li>
	<li>Cover hard-to-reach code that you couldn't test before</li>
	<li>Write custom assertions and expectations specifically for your application</li>
	<li>Build and release your own framework extensions</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
