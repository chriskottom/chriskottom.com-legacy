      <p>
	Hi, I'm Chris Kottom, and I've been building web applications
	since the mid-90s. When I first discovered Rails in 2006, I'd
	been a Java developer for over ten years and was pretty burned
	out by the experience.  Discovering Ruby reminded me how much
	I loved coding and brought me back to it.
      </p>

      <p>
	I came to Ruby with almost no previous experience writing
	automated tests, but I was immediately able to see the value
	in terms of software quality and programmer productivity.
	Like a lot of longtime Rubyists, I've used plenty of different
	testing frameworks over the years - Test::Unit, Shoulda,
	RSpec, and now finally arriving at Minitest.  I'm writing this
	book because I think I've finally found a way of testing
	that's reliable and that I can live with long-term.  I hope I
	can share that with other developers and help them do the same.
