	<h1>Your tests are talking to you.</h1>
	<h2>Can you trust what they're saying?</h2>

      You've read more than your share of blog posts and books, and you've worked your way through tutorials and programming exercises - some of them more than once.   All in your spare time, all because you care about your code and want it to be awesome, all in the name of calling yourself a real Ruby developer.  You've shown that you're willing to do the work, that you give a damn.
    </p>

    <p>
      And after all those late nights and mental gymnastics, you're still left with this sneaking suspicion that your tests aren't everything they should be.  Everything you thought they would be.  Your coverage is only so-so, and you know that there are parts of your code base that you just couldn't figure out how to test.  Running your whole test suite used to take almost no time at all, but now it takes up to a half-hour, and you've gotten into the habit of only running it twice a day - once during the morning scrum, and once during lunch.  This is definitely not what you signed up for.

    <h2>Hey, it's not just you.</h2>

    <p>
      First of all, don't be too tough on yourself if you feel like you're always scrambling to keep up with the latest changes in that other testing framework.  You're not imagining it or being oversensitive.  Did you know that RSpec 3.0 was over twice as big as RSpec 2.0 measured in lines of code?  Between that and all the changes in the API, you can be excused for feeling a little whiplash.

    <p>
      Adding to this is the fact that in recent years the emphasis of much of what's been written about testing in Ruby has been on using modern TDD and BDD workflows to cure what ails modern development.  TDD can be an entirely good thing if that's what works for you, but it's a methodology for design and development, and the correctness of the tests is not the focus.  But automated testing was invented exactly to ensure correctness.  So it's weird and maybe a little sad that even as Rubyists and Rails developers automate more and more tests, there hasn't been nearly enough written about testing tactics: where to spend your testing effort and how to make sure it's time well spent in the end.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's suppose though that, whatever your development workflow, you could write tests that were more expressive, easier to read, faster to run, and which more closely mapped to your domain.  Wouldn't that be worth some of your time?

      A lot of Ruby developers are starting to use Minitest because of its super-simple syntax and its lightning-fast execution, but when you dig into the source code, you see it for what it really is: a set of basic building blocks for testing Ruby applications.
