      <h1>Write more effective tests.</h1>

      <p>
	You've been through it all - blog posts and books, screencasts
	and tutorials and programming exercises.  All because you care
	about code and want yours to be awesome.
      </p>

      <p>
	All this time, you've had the importance of testing hammered
	into your head, and it's fine, you get it.  But still it's been
	hard to escape the nagging feeling that <em>your tests should be
	doing more</em> for you than they are now.

      Does any of this sound familiar?
      <ul>
	<li>
	  You twiddled with your testing stack configuration for weeks
	  to get it working reasonably well, but you're still not sure
	  you've got all the kinks worked out.
	</li>
	<li>
	  You know that certain parts of your code base aren't covered
	  - just because you never could figure out how to test them.
	</li>
	<li>
	  That awesome testing framework that lets you write tests
	  that read like English?  They just released a new version
	  with a new syntax, and now the docs and all your favorite
	  blogs use examples that look nothing like what you wrote.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Your whole test suite used to run in no time at all, but now
	  it's a minimum of 20 minutes, and you can only afford to run
	  it when you know you're going to be away from your computer.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Ruby and Rails developers emphasize testing for good reasons,
      and you want to get on board, but even so, it can be damn hard
      to learn.  You just want to write tests that tell you when
      you're breaking something, run fast, and guide you in your work.
