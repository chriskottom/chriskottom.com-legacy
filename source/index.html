	<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
	<p>Life is where you find it.  I've lived in the <em>Czech Republic</em> since the year 2000.  When I moved to work with a long-gone startup, I told everyone I would be here <em>"for a year or two"</em>.</p>
	<p>I've spent a good chunk of the past 20 years hunched over a keyboard working on <em>system architecture &amp; design</em> and <em>web applications</em> - most recently using <em>Ruby on Rails</em> and <em>JavaScript</em>.</p>

	<p>Website renovations.  I've been trying to get back into a regular writing practice this year, and so redesigning my blog and personal homepage has been an attempt at having a vehicle for doing so.</p>
