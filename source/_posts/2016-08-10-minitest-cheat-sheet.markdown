Recently I came across a [post](http://www.notmagic.org/minitest-dilemma) that called out a perceived lack of available documentation and other learning material for Minitest in contrast with RSpec.  And while I'm not entirely sure I agree with the premise, the main point of the article had the ring of truth to it:

> If there's a problem to be solved here, it's that the obvious parts
> of Minitest need to be better documented. Organize the new documentation
> in the format of "I want to do xyz thing",with an example.

Honestly, what project couldn't use better docs - more focused, more examples, and detailed explanations?  That was exactly the same line of thinking that got me thinking about writing [The Minitest Cookbook](http://chriskottom.com/minitestcookbook).

I released a cheat sheet with the book that I thought might provide people with a partial solution, so I prepared a simplified version that includes a reference to the basic methods and syntax for Minitest and Minitest::Spec as well as a full listing of all assertions and expectations for each along with simple code examples for context.  (The full version also includes Rails-specific helpers and assertions and a list of the most commonly used Capybara methods.)

Enjoy, and [let me know](mailto:chris@chriskottom.com?subject=cheatsheet) if it helps you.
