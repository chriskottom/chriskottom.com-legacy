I've recently been working on learning some of the basics of SaaS, and at times, I've found myself getting wrapped up in unfamiliar terms and acronyms. While there are plenty of [good][1] [resources][2] out there for this domain, I was looking for something simple that I could keep open on my desktop as a reference, and finding nothing, I decided to make my own.<!--more-->

[SaaS Glossary][3] is a little single-page app I whipped together this morning. Based on [Bootstrap][4], it provides a simple interface that gives easy access to some of the most common terminology used in blog posts and books about SaaS.

This is a partial morning of work, but I'll be making improvements to the code and adding and improving definitions as time goes on. In the meantime, I've posted the [source code][5] to [GitHub][6] for anyone who'd like to contribute.
