<p class="preface">Are you working on a new SaaS application and need advice from someone who’s been there? I’m a veteran of multiple startups and dozens of web and IT projects. Let’s schedule a call to talk about the questions and challenges you’re currently facing and how to solve them.</p>

### How will it work?

1. Schedule a time and date for our consultation call.
2. I’ll send you an invoice with payment details (to be paid before the call) and a questionnaire to get clear on how I can help you.
3. We’ll meet up at the scheduled time and date via Appear.in or Skype.
4. During the call, we’ll discuss your particular problem or question (with screen sharing, if necessary).
5. After the call, you’ll receive a recording of it and a summary of the key points we discussed.

## Ready to get started?
