### 60-Minute Consultation Call

Let's schedule a call to talk about the questions and challenges you're currently facing and how to solve them. I'll provide you with a recording of the conversation and a short overview of the points we cover.

### Application Audit

Have you just inherited a Rails application with few tests and no documentation?  Or maybe you have an older app in need of an overhaul, and you'd like a second opinion about where to get started? I'll carefully examine your application's code and tests and compile a detailed 15-25 page report describing any issues and providing specific, prioritized recommendations for next steps. You can use the report to plan and prioritize work for your team, or hire me to do it for you. This package includes two 1-hour consultations at the beginning and end of the project

### Application Rescue

Are you working on a legacy Rails application with messy code and bad (or nonexistent) tests?  Afraid to make a change for fear that you'll break something?  I've spent a lot of time over the years troubleshooting and improving apps like these. I can work with your app to assess your current situation, refactor your code, improve test coverage, upgrade dependencies, and get you moving again.

	Rescue packages start at <s>$3999</s> <strong>$2999</strong> depending on project size.
